# Gui-based-Brain-Tumor-Dtection-Project
Detecting Brain Tumor through Convolutional Neural Network  and showing it on the Graphical User Interface
In the project for Brain tumor detection. We used CNN (convolution neural network ). The code is in python file CNN_ON_MRI dataset . We dumped the model  as model.h5 and used this dumped model in Gui for accessing model and used Data in      Brain tumor dataset (testing folder ) for image prediction.

When In gui we want to access images we use from Brain Data (testing data ). And image is predicted.
